      <h1>Etymology</h1>

      <p>
        The spider originally bearing the name tarantula was Lycosa tarantula, a
        species of wolf spider native to Mediterranean Europe.[9] The name is
        derived from the southern Italian town of Taranto.[10] The term
        tarantula was subsequently applied to almost any large, unfamiliar
        species of ground-dwelling spider, in particular to the Mygalomorphae
        and especially the New World Theraphosidae. Compared to tarantulas, wolf
        spiders are not particularly large or hairy, and so among English
        speakers in particular, usage eventually shifted in favour of the
        Theraphosidae, even though they are not closely related to wolf spiders
        at all, being in a different infraorder.

      <p>
        Tarantula native to the Mojave Desert searches for burrow. Aphonopelma
        mojave. Tarantula native to the Mojave Desert searches for a burrow. The
        name tarantula is also incorrectly applied to other large-bodied
        spiders, including the purseweb spiders or atypical tarantulas, the
        funnel-webs (Dipluridae and Hexathelidae), and the dwarf tarantulas.
        These spiders are related to tarantulas (all being mygalomorphs) but
        fall into different families from them. Huntsman spiders of the family
        Sparassidae have also been termed tarantulas because of their large
        size, when, in fact, they are not related. Instead, huntsman spiders
        belong to the infraorder Araneomorphae.

      <strong>The element pelma in genus names</strong>

      <p>
        Many theraphosid genera have names, either accepted or synonymous,
        containing the element pelma. This can be traced back to Carl Ludwig
        Koch in 1850,[11] who in describing his new genus Eurypelma wrote, "Die
        Sammetbürste der Fussohlen sehr breit" (lit. 'the velvet-brush of the
        footsole very wide').[12] German arachnologists use the word Fuß to
        refer to the tarsus (the last article of a spider's leg).[13]
        Translations of Sammetbürste into Latin use the word scopula.[14] Hence
        in English arachnological terminology, Koch meant 'the scopula of the
        base of the tarsus very wide'. Eury- is derived from the Greek eurýs
        (εὐρύϛ), meaning 'wide', while pélma (πέλμα) means 'the sole of the
        foot',[11] paralleling Koch's use of Fußsohle (in modern spelling). Thus
        Eurypelma literally means 'wide footsole'; however, arachnologists have
        conventionally taken pelma in such names to refer to the scopula, so
        producing the meaning 'with a wide scopula'.[11]
      </p>

      <p>
        Other genus names or synonyms that Estrada-Alvarez and Cameron regard as
        having 'footsole' or 'scopula' meanings include:[11]
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Acanthopelma - Greek ácantha (ἄκανθα) 'thorn, spine'; overall meaning
          'spiny footsole'
        </li>
        <li>
          Brachypelma - Greek brachýs (βραχύϛ) 'short'; overall meaning 'short
          scopula'
        </li>
        <li>
          Metriopelma - Greek métrios (μέτριοϛ) 'of moderate size'; overall
          meaning 'medium length scopula'
        </li>
        <li>
          Schizopelma - from the Greek origin combining form schizo- (σχίζω)
          'split'; overall meaning 'split footsole'
        </li>
        <li>
          Metriopelma - Sericopelma - Greek sericós (σηρικόϛ) 'silky'; overall
          meaning 'silken scopula'
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Later, particularly following genus names published by R.I. Pocock in
        1901,[15] the element pelma appears to have become synonymous with
        'theraphosid'. For example, the author of Cardiopelma writes,
        "Cardiopelma fait réference aux genitalia de la femelle qui évoquent la
        forme d'un Coeur" ('Cardiopelma refers to the female genitalia that
        evoke the shape of a heart'), with no reference to either 'footsole' or
        'scopula'. Names interpreted in this way include:[11]
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Aphonopelma - Greek áphonos (ἄφωνοϛ) 'soundless'; overall meaning
          'theraphosid without sound'
        </li>
        <li>
          Cardiopelma - Greek cardía (καρδία) 'heart'; overall meaning 'heart
          theraphosid' (referring to the heart-shaped female genitalia)
        </li>
        <li>
          Clavopelma - Latin clavis 'club'; overall meaning 'theraphosid with
          club-shaped hairs'
        </li>
        <li>
          Delopelma - Greek delós (δηλόϛ) 'clear, obvious, visible, conspicuous,
          plain'; overall meaning 'theraphosid without plumose hair'
        </li>
        <li>
          Gosipelma - the element gosi- means 'desert', relating to the Gosiute
          people; overall meaning 'desert theraphosid'
        </li>
        <li>
          Spelopelma - Greek spélaion (σπήλαιον) 'cave'; overall meaning 'cave
          theraphosid'
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Distribution</h2>

      <p>
        Tarantulas of various species occur throughout the United States,
        Mexico, in Central America, and throughout South America. Other species
        occur variously throughout Africa, much of Asia (including the Ryukyu
        Islands in southern Japan), and all of Australia. In Europe, some
        species occur in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, southern Italy, and Cyprus.
